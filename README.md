Fake News Detection Using Advance Deep Learning is my MSC.DATA SCIENCE project which give the user about the news headline is Fake or Real. This is my first
Deep Learning Project which is successful and needs to improve. In this project I have used Deep learning using Tensorflow and models used such as CNN, LSTM, Tranformers and used precprossing techniques along with visualiztion tools like
Matplotlib, used Data Manupulation tools like Pandas and used to extract the domain from the dataset such tldextract library and as for User Interface (UI) used Streamlit which is the best for UI.
I need to improve this project with advance features which will solve the real-world problems. I am working on the others project which increase my knowledge in my fields
